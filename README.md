[WHAT IS IT]
Timeless Tom is a little tool to keep track of when you work, pause and stop. It depends on Python3

[HOW TO USE]
You basically have 5 commands you need to know:

1. 'start'
Starts logging. You type this when you start your work

2. 'pause'
Pauses logging. You use this if you already started but want to continue working.

3. 'continue'
Continues logging. You use this when you are currently paused and now want to continue with your work.

4. 'stop'
Stops logging. You use this if you are done for the day.

5. 'exit'
Closed the program. You should use this instead of clicking the X, but I can't stop you.

[HELP]
There are a couple more commands. To get a list of them inside the program type 'help'.
- 'usage' will display what you are reading now
- 'licence' will display the full GPL 3.0 licence
- 'clear' will clear the current window

[INFO]
This program is case-insensitive. It does not matter if you write HELP, help or HeLp.
